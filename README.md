     Project Title
Data Structure Classification and Applications
      Description
This project demonstrates the classification of data structures and their implementation using the C programming language.It also explains their applications and how they work in real systems.
The assignment covers:
1. Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Structures
2. Linear and Non-Linear Data Structures
3. Applications of each data structure
4. How data structures and algorithms work within systems
   
🗂 Data Structure Classification
🔹 Primitive
1. int
2. float
3. char
4. boolean
🔹 Non-Primitive
1. Linear:
Array
Linked List
Stack
Queue
2. Non-Linear:
Tree
Graph

 Implemented Structures
1. Array
2. Linked List
3. Stack (LIFO)
4. Queue (FIFO)
5. Tree

  Applications
Array: Fast indexed access (e.g., storing marks)
Linked List: Easy insertion/deletion (e.g., playlists)
Stack: Undo/Redo operations
Queue: Scheduling systems
Tree: File systems & databases
Graph: Navigation & social networks
